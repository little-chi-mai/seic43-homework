# Books I

## Specification

Build a search form that lets the user enter a book title. The Sinatra app will use HTTParty to fetch the data for the chosen book from Google Books and display it on the page. Display the cover, as a bare minimum.

## Sample URL

https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=title:Ulysses
